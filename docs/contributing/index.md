## PR merge requirements

For good project quality, we have following requirements to get PR merged:

* automated Travis CI test must pass,
* created PR must contain description of change, this information will be added by maintainer to changelog after merge.

## Merge process

1. check PR merge requirements are met,
2. perform merge (not fast forward merge),
3. update changelog,
4. release a new version.
